# this going to be a password checker 


# Asking the user for User Name
user_name = input('Enter the username')

#Asking the user for Password
password = input('Enter your password')

password_length = len(password)
password_length = '*' * password_length

print(f"Hey {user_name}, your password length is {password_length}")

# basically very basic program
